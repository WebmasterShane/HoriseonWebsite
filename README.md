# Horiseon Website Refactor

Horiseon is a marketing agency, with a focus on the marketing needs of companies in the digital age.
My goal was to refactor the websites syntax.


## My Contribution

I deployed semantic html elements (replacing div) to make the code easier to read.
for example, section, aside, nav, and footer.
I restructed elements into a logical order so as to read the document top to bottom
and have the elements show up under the tags appropriate to their placement on the page
i consolidated redundant css class tags 
i reorganized css class tags to a more logical order
i added alt tags to all images as to make the website more accessible to the visually impared.
i repaired the syntax on a broken button in the nav bar
